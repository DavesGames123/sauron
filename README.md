### Know what your agents changed — before you ship it.

A read-only sidecar for running **many coding agents at once** — [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) — and never losing track of which ones left work you haven't tested.

## Why

When you fan out a swarm of coding agents, the bottleneck stops being *writing*
code and becomes *trusting* it. Which sessions actually touched the repo? Which
are quietly **blocked on a question only you can answer**? What have you already
reviewed? **sauron** answers exactly that — and nothing else.

The watcher reads each agent's session logs, re-tailing every two seconds. It
**writes nothing to your repo** and **never talks to a running agent**.

---

## 🎭 The cast

You are Sauron. Your servants get the work done; the Eye keeps watch.

| | Who | What they do |
|:-:|:--|:--|
| 🧝 | **hobbits** | the agents you direct — resumed into the `workspace` panes to do the real quests |
| 👹 | **orcs** | single-shot maintenance agents you loose on the *cold* corners: decompose, document, de-warn |
| 👁️ | **the Eye** | sauron itself, watching every session and flagging what needs you |
| 💍 | **Nazgûl** | *reserved* — the Nine are for something worse, later |

<br>

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🛰️ `sauron`
The terminal sidecar. One question, answered live:
> *what did my agents change that I haven't tested yet?*

- Flags each session **needs-test · blocked · clear**
- **Acknowledge** work as you verify it — progress persists
- Surfaces sessions **blocked on a question** first
- Collapses the historical backlog so *today's* work stays visible
- Quotes your **last message** to each session, and previews the **recent
  edits** of the selected one — re-brief at a glance
- And a lidless **Eye** keeps watch up top, Mount Doom smoking beside it — both
  gauged to the swarm. Idle, the Eye **lids**, the war ends, and the Fellowship
  (and Gandalf, and the Eagles…) get the plain to themselves

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🪟 `sauron workspace`
A subcommand of the same binary. One command, a whole cockpit:

- Opens a **fullscreen layout on its own Space**
- A column of **bare `claude` panes** (pick how many)
- `sauron` wired into the top-right, shells below
- Panes stay evenly sized no matter the agent count

### 🌐 `sauron serve`
The same swarm, in a **browser** — see
[below](#-sauron-serve--the-whole-thing-in-a-browser). The board as a real web
app, and the agents running in ptys sauron owns. No iTerm, no macOS.

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
# the shortest path: build, serve, and open the board in a browser
./run.sh
```

<sub>`./run.sh /path/to/repo` for a specific one · `--tui` for the terminal front
end instead · `--no-open` to serve without launching a browser · `--help` for
the rest. It walks up from port 7373 if that one is taken, so a second repo in a
second tab needs no arguments.</sub>

Or drive the binary yourself:

```bash
# 1 · build the sidecar and Agent Clipboard
cargo build --release --manifest-path sauron/Cargo.toml

# 2 · watch the repo you're standing in
./sauron/target/release/sauron

# …or watch a specific repo
./sauron/target/release/sauron /path/to/repo
```

Drop it on your `PATH` to call it from anywhere:

```bash
cp sauron/target/release/sauron sauron/target/release/clip /usr/local/bin/
```

---

## 🌐 `sauron serve` — the whole thing, in a browser

Not a picture of the terminal board. A web application: the board laid out as
HTML, and **the agents running inside it** — sauron opens a pseudo-terminal per
agent and the page is the terminal on the end of it. iTerm2 becomes one way to
run a swarm rather than the only way.

```bash
./run.sh                          # build, serve, open a tab — the usual way in

# or drive it directly:
sauron serve                      # → http://127.0.0.1:7373
sauron serve --agents 0           # don't reopen in-flight sessions as tabs
sauron serve --port 8080 /path/to/repo
```

**Tabs, like the workspace.** The first tab is the board. Every agent gets its
own, carrying the servant name and colour `servant.rs` derives from its session
id — so a tab, a card on the board, and an iTerm pane for the same session are
all the same colour without anything coordinating. `+` opens a new agent, a
shell at the repo root, or an orc on a cold file. <kbd>⌘1</kbd>…<kbd>⌘9</kbd>
jump between them.

**The board is a board, not a screenshot.** Cards grouped by attention — errored,
waiting on you, to acknowledge, to test — each with what the agent last wrote,
what you last said to it, and a per-file preview of the pending edits. Acknowledge,
dismiss, or open a terminal on the session, in place.

**Closing the tab does not stop your agents.** The ptys belong to sauron, so a
reload, a closed laptop, or a second browser on another machine changes nothing
about a turn in progress — reattaching replays the scrollback. Ending an agent is
the `×` on its tab, and it asks first.

**It binds loopback, and it has no password.** This is stronger than it was when
`serve` only showed you a board: the page opens shells and runs agents on this
machine as you. Anyone who can reach the port has your terminal. `--bind` will
open it wider if you have decided that is fine, and warns you once. Over an
untrusted network, forward the port over ssh instead:

```bash
ssh -N -L 7373:127.0.0.1:7373 you@thatbox   # then open http://127.0.0.1:7373
```

The terminal emulator is [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org), vendored into
`sauron/assets/vendor/` and served from the binary — the page fetches nothing
from the network.

## 🏷 Which repo am I looking at

The header answers that before it reports anything else. The project's name is
set in three rows of block letters across the top left, with its path — home
collapsed to `~` — faint above it:

```
 ~/Downloads/agentwatch                        ᛈᛖᛞᛟ᛬ᛗᛖᛚᛚᛟᚾ᛬ᚨ᛬ᛗᛁᚾᚾᛟ    · ▓▒ ▒░░░
 ╔═╗ ╔═╗ ╔═╗ ╔╗╔ ╔╦╗ ╦ ╦ ╦ ╔═╗ ╔╦╗ ╔═╗ ╦ ╦                            ▗▟▀▙▖
 ╠═╣ ║ ╦ ║╣  ║║║  ║  ║ ║ ║ ╠═╣  ║  ║   ╠═╣                          ▗▟█████▙▖
 ╩ ╩ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╝╚╝  ╩  ╚═╩═╝ ╩ ╩  ╩  ╚═╝ ╩ ╩                        ▗▟█╲████╱███▙▖
```

Sauron is normally run several at a time, one pane per project, and the name
used to be nine dim cells beside the word `sauron`. A board you can misread at a
glance is a board you will act on believing it is a different one — and the two
boards easiest to confuse are two checkouts of the same repo, which is why the
path is printed under the name rather than instead of it.

It shrinks in steps rather than disappearing: airy block letters, then condensed
block letters (which is what fits a 52-column workspace pane), then small
capitals, then the front of the name. There is no width at which the header
declines to say which repo it is on.

---

## 🌋 The skyline — Mordor answers to the board

The chrome is a gauge, not decoration. Everything above and below the session
list is a pure function of two numbers: how many agents are **working**, and
whether anything at all is **outstanding**.

**While the swarm runs.** The Eye burns and tracks whatever crosses beneath it.
**Orodruin** smokes on the skyline beside it — one degree of heat per working
agent, from a thin wisp to a thick plume, a white-hot vent, embers thrown clear
of the cone and lava running down its flanks. At the tower's foot the **war**
musters on the same count: more fighters, faster feet, arrow volleys past three,
the fallen past five. The tower's arrow-slits are lit. Once every twenty-six
seconds Frodo, Sam, and Gollum steal across the field, and the Eye follows them.

**When nothing is running and nothing wants you** — the state the header calls
*all caught up* — the board doesn't merely go quiet, it changes state:

- the **Eye banks and lids**: the flame crown gutters to a bed of coals and the
  lid closes over the fire, cracking open once a cycle for a slow look around
- the tower's **slit-windows go dark**
- the **mountain cools** — two tones of dead rock, a dull seam at the vent
- the **war stops entirely**. Not one bored orc left keeping the gate: an empty
  field is the only way to say *nothing is happening* that a shuffling sentry
  does not contradict
- and the plain fills up. **A different company crosses every fourteen seconds**,
  rotating through the whole cast:

  | | company | |
  |:--|:--|:--|
  | `ó╱ ô╱ o╮ *` | Frodo, Sam, Gollum, and the Ring | on foot |
  | `╲╱╤ó ·` | Gandalf on Shadowfax | the fastest thing on the ground |
  | `╱▄╲` | a Nazgûl on its fell beast | *in the air* |
  | `ó) °╕` | Legolas and Gimli | bow and axe |
  | `Ψ╱` | Treebeard | twelve seconds to cross |
  | `╱╲ ╲╱ ╱╲` | Gwaihir and his kin | *in the air* |
  | `ô╱ ~` | Tom Bombadil | singing |
  | `╳o╳` | Shelob | skittering |

The rotation is driven by the clock, not a random number, so every frame of it
is reproducible in a test — and no company ever shows up twice in a row.

> The idle state is deliberately strict: it needs **nothing working, nothing
> delegated, and nothing errored, blocked, awaiting ack, or awaiting test**. A
> lidded Eye above an amber `AWAITING ACK` badge would be the chrome calling the
> badge a liar, and you'd have no way to tell which one to believe.

Everything on the header lays out around the project's name, in this order: the
name first, the mountain in whatever columns are left, the engraving in whatever
is left after that. The mountain is the one that goes on a narrow terminal —
it is scenery, and the name is the only thing up there that is information.
Below 24 rows the header collapses to a one-line Eye and the name moves into a
filled badge on the status line; the tower and its war are only drawn when the
terminal can spare them.

## 📋 Agent Clipboard

Sauron includes a Rust implementation of the
[Forge Agent Clipboard](https://github.com/alvinlu7/forge). It preserves the
SQLite schema, FTS5 index, JSON record shape, TTL/version/checksum behavior, and
validated-before-pin policy, so the Python and Rust tools can share one database.

Use either entry point:

```bash
clip put project.current.invariants --file invariants.md --namespace project
clip search "project invariants" --namespace project --json
clip get project.current.invariants

# The same CLI is available through the Sauron binary.
sauron clip copy project.current.invariants
```

The complete command surface is `put`, `update`, `get`, `copy`, `search`, `list`,
`recent`, `pin`, `delete`, `export`, `import`, `stats`, `doctor`, and `gc`.
Override storage with `--db PATH` / `--db-path PATH` or
`$AGENT_CLIPBOARD_DB`. Otherwise Sauron reuses an ancestor
`.agent-clipboard/clipboard.sqlite3` when present, then falls back to the normal
platform data directory.

---

## 🪟 `sauron workspace` — the multi-agent cockpit

> **macOS + iTerm2**, or **Windows + Windows Terminal** — see
> [Windows](#-windows) for what the second one does and does not do.

```bash
sauron workspace                  # the repo you're standing in, with a quick prompt
sauron workspace 8                # …suggesting 8 panes
sauron workspace 8 <project>      # a specific project — count & project any order
sauron workspace 8 .              # the current folder, explicitly
sauron workspace 5 --orcs 2       # 5 hobbits + 2 orcs (see below)
sauron workspace 5 --mordor       # run the swarm on a local model (see 🌋 below)
sauron workspace 5 --clipboard-handoff  # strict read-at-start/write-at-end passes
sauron workspace 8 <project> -y   # skip the prompt (also skipped when scripted)
```

A bare **`sauron workspace`** opens the **repository you're in** (the git repo
containing your cwd) and asks a quick question first:

```
  sauron workspace  →  /Users/you/code/worldsmith   (claude)
  panes [5]: 
  orcs  [0]: 
  launch 5 pane(s), 0 orc(s)? [Y/n]
```

Press Enter to accept each, type a number to change it, `q` to bail. Pass `-y`
(or pipe/redirect stdin) to skip the dialogue entirely.

### Strict clipboard handoffs

`--clipboard-handoff` wraps every launched hobbit and orc in an opt-in continuity
gate:

1. Before the agent starts, Sauron opens the clipboard, loads the exact prior
   lane handoff plus the highest-signal entries for this repository, and injects
   that context into the first prompt.
2. Before the agent exits, its instructions require a structured JSON handoff:
   completed work, repo/test state, invariants and decisions, blockers, and the
   precise next action.
3. After exit, Sauron reopens the database and verifies that the lane key has a
   new version containing the pass nonce. A missing or unreadable handoff marks
   the pass incomplete with exit code `3`.

Keys and namespaces are deterministic from the canonical repository path and
workspace lane, keeping parallel panes separate while allowing every later pass
to retrieve the repository's recent handoffs. Without the flag, workspace launch
commands and behavior are unchanged.

### 👹 orcs — the maintenance swarm

`--orcs N` stages **N single-shot maintenance agents** in the right column, aimed
at the *cold* corners of the repo — source files **no active session is touching**
and nothing has dirtied in git, ranked by **lines of code plus recent churn**
(a file that gets reopened over and over is structurally wrong more reliably than
a file that is merely long).

Each orc is handed **one file and a ranked charge**, not a list of equal wishes:

1. **Decompose** — split it into a nested module tree, one concern per file, each
   with a header saying what it is for and the grep targets to reach its parts.
   This **outranks the other two combined**; a correct split is a complete result.
2. **Shrink** — cut the line count of what remains without losing behaviour or
   documentation, and report the before/after per file.
3. **Speed** — only where the code makes the win evident (hoist work out of a
   loop, drop a large clone, replace a repeated scan with a lookup), each with a
   one-line reason. Speculative micro-tuning is explicitly forbidden.

Above all three sits a **hard constraint: the tree must compile and the program
must still boot at every moment the orc is working**, not merely when it
finishes — because a hobbit is building this repo the whole time. The charge
spells out the discipline that makes that true: run the build *before* the first
edit, work additive-first (create and wire in the new module, compile, *then*
delete from the original), re-run the build after every step, revert any step
that goes red rather than pressing on, and never touch the build manifest or
entrypoint to make a change compile. sauron fills in the actual commands from the
repo's manifest — including the subdirectory to run them from — and reads the
boot check from `$SAURON_ORC_SMOKE`.

> There is no ecosystem default for the boot check on purpose. Whether a program
> *boots* is a property of the program, not the toolchain: `cargo build` passing
> says nothing about whether `main` reaches its event loop. A guessed command
> would have the orc certify a boot it never performed.
>
> ```bash
> export SAURON_ORC_SMOKE='cargo run --quiet -- --once'   # for sauron itself
> ```

- **They don't start on their own.** The command is *typed into each orc pane but
  not run* — you review the target and press **Enter** to loose it. What gets
  typed is short enough to actually read: `sauron orc src/big.rs`.
- **They're marked distinct.** An orc session wears a green **`orc`** badge in the
  TUI, so you can tell sauron's own maintenance work apart from the **hobbits**
  doing your directed quests.
- **They only take what's safe**, so they can never collide with a hobbit
  mid-edit — and the cold check is **re-run at dispatch**, not trusted from when
  the list was built, so a file a hobbit grabbed in the meantime is refused.

### Loosing an orc from the TUI

`--orcs N` only fires at launch, which is the wrong moment: the hot/cold snapshot
is taken before any hobbit has started, and the pane budget is fixed forever.
Press **`O`** in the running TUI instead and you get a live picker.

```
┌ loose an orc — decompose first ──────────────────────┐
│ ▸ sauron/src/clip/store.rs            1178 loc · 4 commits │
│   sauron/src/clip/mod.rs               633 loc · 2 commits │
│   12 cold · 3 hot · 9 dirty held back                │
│   ⏎ stage orc   j/k move   esc close                 │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

It shows the evidence behind each rank rather than asking you to trust the
ordering, and it says out loud how many candidates were **held back** — silent
filtering reads as "there was nothing else", which is a different and false
claim. **Enter** splits a new pane in sauron's own column and *stages* the orc
there, same as at launch: typed, awaiting your Enter. Outside a workspace window
there's no pane to split, so the command goes to the clipboard instead.

`<project>` is a directory (path, `~`, `.`) **or** a short alias you've saved
into workspace memory:

```bash
sauron workspace alias api ~/code/api-service   # then:  sauron workspace 6 api
sauron workspace alias worldsmith ~/code/worldsmith
sauron workspace alias                          # list saved aliases
sauron workspace unalias api                    # forget one
```

It spins up a new iTerm2 window, throws it into native fullscreen (which gives
it its own macOS Space), then splits it into a left column of `claude` panes and
a right column with `sauron` on top. The panes reopen each in-flight session
(`claude --resume`) pulled straight from the scanner — the same set the TUI
shows — and run `sauron` itself for the watcher, by the very path you invoked, so
a restored window keeps working. Registry lives at `~/.claude/sauron/workspaces`.

### Growing the column without leaving the TUI

Closing an agent you're done with was always one keystroke. Opening one back up
was a split, a `cd`, and a typed command — so the swarm only ever shrank. Two
keys in the watcher close that loop:

| Key | Opens | Focus |
|:---:|:--|:--|
| <kbd>n</kbd> | a fresh agent at the repo root | **stays in sauron** — press it three times for three panes |
| <kbd>⏎</kbd> | the *selected* session, resumed | **follows the new pane** — you opened it to talk to it |
| <kbd>O</kbd> | the cold-file picker → a **staged orc** in sauron's own column | follows the orc pane, which is waiting on your Enter |

<kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>⏎</kbd> land in the **left column** and split whichever pane there is currently
tallest, so the column stays even instead of one pane shrinking by half each
time. The column is found live rather than remembered: iTerm2 enumerates a tab's
panes in split-tree order and the layout carves the right column off as the
second child, so *everything ahead of the sauron pane is the agent column* — a
fact that stays true however many panes you close. This means it also works in
workspace windows opened before this feature existed.

<kbd>⏎</kbd> is the counterpart to closing a pane: the session outlives its
terminal, so a session you shut the window on — or one that went blocked
overnight — comes back with its history intact. It does not check whether that
session is already open in another pane; two live panes on one session is not a
state Claude Code guards against, so don't.

If a spawn can't happen — sauron isn't running in an iTerm2 pane, there is no
agent column left of it, or iTerm2 refuses the split because the column has hit
its minimum pane height — the footer says which, in amber, for a few seconds.
Panes opened this way run against the hosted API even in a `--mordor` /
`--nostromo` workspace; the local-model env is set at launch and the watcher does
not carry it.

<details>
<summary><b>Requirements</b></summary>

- iTerm2 with the AppleScript API enabled
- Accessibility permission granted to iTerm2

## 🎨 Telling the panes apart

A column of eight identical `claude` panes is a column you have to read to
navigate. Every session sauron opens is therefore given a **servant** — a name
and a colour — derived from its session id:

```
sauron panel                          the agent column
─────────────────────────────────    ──────────────────
● frodo    NEEDS TEST  src/a.rs       [frodo ]  teal pane
  ^teal underline      ^gold status   [sam   ]  violet pane
▲ sam      BLOCKED     waiting        [merry ]  amber pane
  ^violet underline    ^red status    [pippin]  green pane
```

- **The name** comes from `claude --name`, so it shows in the session's prompt
  box, its `/resume` picker entry, and the terminal title.
- **The colour** underlines that session's name on the board and tints its pane
  in iTerm2. Both sides compute it from the session id, so they agree without
  talking to each other — and keep agreeing across restarts.
- Fresh panes are launched with `--session-id`, so a brand-new pane has its
  colour from the first frame instead of one tick later.

The servant colour answers *which session is this*; the status colour on the
glyph and the status word still answers *what state is it in*. They never
collide — the palette deliberately excludes red, gold and grey.

> On Windows the servant travels as the **pane title** only. Windows Terminal
> can't tint one pane: `--tabColor` colours the whole tab, and `--colorScheme`
> needs a scheme predefined in your `settings.json`, which sauron won't write.

---

## 🪟 Windows

The watcher is the whole product, and the watcher is portable: the board,
statuses, acks, baselines, the Eye, `clip`, `panel`, `route`, and `handoff` all
run on **Windows Terminal + PowerShell** exactly as they do on macOS. State lives
under `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\sauron`.

`sauron workspace` works too, driven by `wt.exe` instead of AppleScript. It is
the same layout — agents down the left, the Eye and its shells on the right,
orcs beneath the Eye — reached by a different route, and the route costs three
things worth knowing before you rely on them:

| | macOS / iTerm2 | Windows / Windows Terminal |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Which pane a split lands on | the tallest in the column, measured | the column's first pane — `wt` cannot report a pane's size |
| Handing focus back to the Eye | by session id | by pane index, recorded at launch — closing a pane by hand shifts it |
| Staging an orc | typed in, Enter withheld | pushed onto the shell history, one **Up** from running |

Three things are **macOS only** and say so rather than failing quietly:

- **`sauron gui`** — docking a project's own window into the pane grid needs a
  scriptable window server.
- **`sauron gui --mirror`** — same reason.
- **`sauron reply`** — delivery finds the terminal a process is typing into by
  joining on the session's `tty`, which iTerm2 publishes. Windows Terminal
  publishes nothing and accepts no text, so there is no route back. The outbox
  stays empty on Windows instead of filling with messages nothing will carry.

<details>
<summary><b>Requirements</b></summary>

<br>

- Windows Terminal (`wt.exe` on `PATH`)
- PowerShell 5.1 or 7 — `pwsh` is used when present, else the built-in
- `git` on `PATH`, as on any platform

</details>

<summary><b>Build and run</b></summary>

## 🖥 GUI projects — the thing you're building, in the layout

> **Opt-in per repo. A repo that declares nothing gets the ordinary layout, byte
> for byte.**

Most repos sauron watches are not terminal programs. When the project has an
application of its own, the workspace holds a column open for it:

```
┌──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
│              │              │              │
│   agents     │   your app   │    sauron    │
│              │  (its own    │   (the Eye)  │
│              │   window)    │              │
│              ├──────────────┤              │
│              │   app log    │              │
└──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

Declare it in the repo — the project is the thing that knows how it launches, and
the declaration should travel with the checkout:

```bash
# <repo>/.sauron/gui.conf
cmd  = ./run.sh          # required; run through `sh -c` from the repo root
keep = app               # app | raise | off  (see below)
rect = 0.33,0,0.33,0.66  # optional: the app's share of the window
app  = stella-nova       # optional: only if the process tree walk misses it
```

Then `sauron workspace` lays out three equal columns instead of two, and stages
`sauron gui` in the strip under the hole — **typed, not run**, the same contract
an orc has. `run.sh` is a release build; a window opening is not consent to start
one. Press Enter and the app launches, its output fills the strip, and its window
is docked into the column above.

`--gui='./run.sh'` docks a repo that has declared nothing; `--no-gui` opens the
ordinary layout in a repo that has.

### Two things macOS decides for you

**A GUI workspace is not natively fullscreen.** A fullscreen Space accepts
exactly one window, so a fullscreened workspace could never share a screen with
the application it is holding a hole open for. The window is sized to the display
instead — asked of AppKit, so it knows where your Dock is.

**Whether the app can be moved from outside depends on how it was built.** This is
the part worth reading before you file a bug:

| Your app is… | What works | Why |
|:--|:--|:--|
| a bundled `.app` | `keep = raise` — sauron moves, sizes, and re-raises it, no cooperation needed | it publishes an Accessibility window hierarchy |
| a bare binary (`cargo run`) | `keep = app` — the app places itself | it publishes **no** AX windows at all |

That second row is measured, not guessed: a running winit app, `background only
= false`, `visible = true`, frontmost — and `count of windows` still `0`. No API
reaches that window from outside the process. So sauron hands every child the
coordinates instead:

```bash
SAURON_DOCK_RECT=537,33,487,633   # x,y,w,h in points, the hole in this window
SAURON_DOCK_TOP=1                 # keep = app: pin yourself above the terminal
```

…and the app spends four lines placing itself. In winit 0.30:

```rust
if let Ok(r) = std::env::var("SAURON_DOCK_RECT") {
    let n: Vec<f64> = r.split(',').filter_map(|p| p.trim().parse().ok()).collect();
    if let [x, y, w, h] = n[..] {
        attrs = attrs
            .with_position(LogicalPosition::new(x, y))
            .with_inner_size(LogicalSize::new(w, h));
        if std::env::var("SAURON_DOCK_TOP").as_deref() == Ok("1") {
            attrs = attrs.with_window_level(WindowLevel::AlwaysOnTop);
        }
    }
}
```

`SAURON_DOCK_TOP` is what keeps the app visible when you click into a pane —
macOS raises *all* of an app's windows when you activate it, so without a window
level the terminal would bury the app every time you typed. (For bundled apps
sauron does this from outside with `AXRaise`, which reorders a window **without**
activating its process — the app floats up, your keystrokes stay in the terminal.)

If no window ever appears in Accessibility, the app pane says so once, with the
rect it should have used, rather than polling in silence.

### `--mirror` — the app *inside* a pane

Docking puts a real window in the layout. If you want the picture **in the
terminal itself** — a pane you can look at, with the app running wherever it
likes — mirror it:

```bash
sauron gui --mirror                 # the app named in .sauron/gui.conf
sauron gui --mirror --app worldsmith
sauron gui --mirror --fps 12 --px 1600
sauron gui --mirror --probe         # what it can see, and what it would cost
```

The pane you type it in **splits vertically**: the mirror takes the left half,
a fresh shell at the repo takes the right. Nothing is launched — you started the
app yourself; this attaches to the window it already made.

It captures **by window id off the window server**, so the app can be behind the
terminal, half off the screen, or buried under another window and the mirror
still shows it. That is the property that makes this worth having.

What it is not: it is a **picture**. Keys and clicks go to the pane, not to the
program — there is no channel back, and no version of this has one. It runs at
a frame rate rather than at the app's refresh, because each frame is a capture,
a rescale, and a base64 blob down a pty.

> **Screen Recording permission is required** — System Settings → Privacy &
> Security → Screen Recording → iTerm. Without it `screencapture` answers
> `could not create image from window` and the mirror says so rather than
> showing you a blank pane. Reading the *window list* needs no permission;
> reading its *pixels* does.

`--probe` reports the window it picked, the pane's cell grid, the measured
milliseconds per frame, and the resulting bytes per second, so you can pick an
`--fps` from numbers instead of from vibes.

### The panes under the app

The app's window covers real panes, which are marked with a session variable —
not a pane title, which any program rewrites with an escape sequence on every
prompt. <kbd>n</kbd>, <kbd>⏎</kbd>, and <kbd>O</kbd> skip the marked ones, so
growing the agent column never files a live agent away behind a game.

## 🌋 Mordor mode — a local swarm

> **Off the grid. Your servants toil on a model of your own, on your own iron.**

`--mordor` runs the **hobbits and orcs** against a **local** model instead of the
hosted API — the whole swarm, no tokens billed, no network. The **Eye stays on the
hosted API** (it only reads logs; it never calls a model), so nothing about the
watch changes.

It rides on [Ollama's Anthropic-compatible API][ollama-cc] — Claude Code speaks to
a local model with **no proxy and no translation layer**, just a few env vars that
sauron prepends to each servant pane:

```bash
sauron workspace 5 --mordor                    # 5 hobbits on the local model
sauron workspace 5 --mordor --orcs 2           # …and 2 local orcs
sauron workspace 5 --mordor=qwen2.5-coder:7b   # pick the model (see below)
sauron workspace 5 --nostromo                  # …on a remote box over Tailscale (see below)
```

So a session fires against **cloud** (plain `sauron workspace`), the **local Mac**
(`--mordor`), or a **remote box over Tailscale** (`--nostromo`) — your call, per launch.

### Prerequisites

```bash
# 1 · install Ollama, then pull the coder the swarm will run on
ollama pull qwen3-coder      # the default — Qwen3-Coder, the strongest local coder
ollama serve                 # (usually already running on :11434)
```

### What it does

For every hobbit and orc pane, sauron prepends the local endpoint before the
`claude` word — so `cd repo && claude …` becomes:

```bash
cd repo && ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434 \
           ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=ollama ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= \
           ANTHROPIC_MODEL=qwen3-coder \
           ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL=qwen3-coder \
           ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL=qwen3-coder \
           claude --resume <id>
```

The background/small-fast model is pinned to the **same** local tag, so a
single-model box never has a background call reach for a `haiku`-class model you
never pulled. The confirmation dialogue names the realm so a local launch is never
mistaken for an ordinary one:

```
  sauron workspace  →  /Users/you/code/worldsmith   (claude · 🌋 Mordor: qwen3-coder @ http://localhost:11434)
```

### The model

The default is **`qwen3-coder`** — Qwen3-Coder, a 30B MoE agentic coder (256K
context) and the strongest local coding model that fits a 32GB Mac or a 24–32GB
GPU. Override it inline, and point at a non-default Ollama with `$SAURON_MORDOR_URL`:

| Want | Do |
|:--|:--|
| The default coder | `--mordor` |
| A specific tag | `--mordor=qwen2.5-coder:7b` (the right call on an 8GB box) |
| A remote / non-standard Ollama | `SAURON_MORDOR_URL=http://box:11434 sauron workspace 4 --mordor` |
| A remote box over Tailscale | `--nostromo` (endpoint from local config — see below) |

### Over Tailscale — `--nostromo`

`--nostromo` is `--mordor` pointed at another box's Ollama over your tailnet — fire
a local swarm on the beefy machine from your laptop. It takes a model tag the same
way (`--nostromo=qwen2.5-coder:7b`).

The endpoint is a **private tailnet hostname, so it is never stored in this repo.**
sauron reads it from your machine only — `$SAURON_NOSTROMO_URL`, or the first line of
`~/.claude/sauron/nostromo-url`:

```bash
# set it once (choose either); the URL is the Ollama root over Tailscale
echo 'https://<your-box>.<tailnet>.ts.net' > ~/.claude/sauron/nostromo-url
# or: export SAURON_NOSTROMO_URL=https://<your-box>.<tailnet>.ts.net
```

On the **serving box**, `tailscale serve` must terminate HTTPS on :443 and proxy to
Ollama at the root, and Ollama must listen beyond loopback so the tunnel can reach it:

```bash
OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434 ollama serve          # bind past 127.0.0.1, or the tunnel gets refused
tailscale serve --bg --https=443 http://127.0.0.1:11434
```

Run `--nostromo` with neither the env var nor the file set and sauron tells you how to
set them rather than guessing an endpoint.

> **Claude Code only, for now.** Mordor rides Ollama's *Anthropic*-compatible API,
> which is Claude Code's wire format. Codex reaches local models a different way
> (`codex --oss`), so `--mordor` warns and no-ops under `--codex` rather than
> silently running against the hosted API.

## 🤖 Agents — Claude Code, Codex, and beyond

sauron isn't tied to one agent. Everything downstream — the status model, the
cards, workspace, orcs — is agent-agnostic; only *where the logs live* and *how
one record folds into a session* differ, behind a small `Agent` seam
(`src/agent.rs`). **Claude Code** is the default and fully supported; **OpenAI
Codex** is supported too; adding a third is a localized change.

### Choosing an agent

Pick with a flag, the `$SAURON_AGENT` env var, or let it auto-detect — first match wins:

| Precedence | Source | Example |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | flag | `sauron --codex`, `sauron --claude` |
| 2 | env | `SAURON_AGENT=codex sauron` |
| 3 | auto-detect | whichever agent has logs for this repo |
| 4 | default | Claude Code |

The choice flows everywhere:

```bash
sauron                        # watch — auto-detect the agent
sauron --codex                # watch Codex sessions
sauron workspace 5 --codex    # a Codex cockpit: hobbit panes run `codex`,
                              #   the watcher runs `sauron --codex`
sauron workspace 5 --codex --orcs 2   # …and orcs run `codex exec`
```

### Codex specifics

sauron reads Codex rollouts from `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl`, matching them to
the repo by the `cwd` recorded in each rollout, and folds messages into
prompt/turn state and `apply_patch` envelopes into the write-set.

> ⚠️ **Codex support is best-effort and unverified.** It was written against the
> documented rollout format on a machine with no Codex install. It's defensive —
> it degrades rather than crashes — but if edits or prompts look off, **one real
> `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl`** pins the exact field names. The fix is
> isolated to `src/codex.rs`; reports very welcome.

### Adding another agent

Aider, Gemini CLI, Cursor, your own — see **[docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md)** for
the seam and a step-by-step. In short: add an `Agent` variant, give it a spawn
command and a log reader (session discovery + a `fold` that maps records onto the
shared `Session`), and the entire UI, workspace, and orc machinery come for free.

---

## 🔍 How it reads sessions

Each agent stores sessions its own way. **Claude Code** encodes a project path by
swapping separators for dashes:

```
/Users/you/code/my-repo   →   ~/.claude/projects/-Users-you-code-my-repo/
```

**Codex** writes dated rollouts under `~/.codex/sessions/`, tagged with the `cwd`
they ran in. Either way, sauron folds each session's records into a per-session
edit set, subtracts what you've acknowledged, and shows the remainder.
Acknowledgements live in a small state file, so restarting never loses your
place. It re-tails every two seconds, **writes nothing to your repo**, and
**never talks to a running agent**.
