//! sauron -- a sidecar that answers one question: what did my agents change
//! that I have not tested yet?
//!
//! Everything it shows is read out of the Claude Code session logs at
//! ~/.claude/projects/<encoded-repo-path>/*.jsonl. It writes nothing to the repo
//! and never talks to a running agent.
//!
//! Usage:
//!   sauron                  # watch the repo containing the cwd
//!   sauron /path/to/repo    # watch a specific repo
//!   sauron serve            # the board as a web app, agents running inside it
//!
//! `serve` is not this file's business past the dispatch below: it does not use
//! `App`, it does not draw, and it owns the process once it is called. The two
//! front ends share `board::Board` and nothing else, which is the split that
//! lets one be a terminal and the other be a web application instead of forcing
//! either to pretend to be the other. See `web`'s header.
//!
//! The watching itself lives in the library (`board::Board`), shared with the
//! `muthur` multi-project front end; this file is the terminal around it.
//!
//! grep targets:
//!   struct App          -- a Board plus this window's cursor and banners
//!   fn App::refresh     -- rebuild rows, keeping the cursor on its session
//!   fn App::resync      -- refresh that also picks up another process's acks
//!   fn App::jump_table  -- Tab, from one of the board's tables to the next
//!   fn App::scroll_at   -- the wheel, which moves a table and not the cursor
//!   fn hit_test         -- a clicked row of the screen -> the session in it
//!   fn main             -- terminal lifecycle and event loop
