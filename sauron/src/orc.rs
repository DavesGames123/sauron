//!
//! An orc is loosed on a *cold* file: one no live session is editing and git
//! reports clean. Its brief is built here rather than assembled into a shell
//! string by the launcher, because the pane command is then short enough to read
//! before you press Enter (`sauron orc src/big.rs`), and the brief itself is free
//! of shell and AppleScript quoting -- it reaches the agent through
//! `Command::arg`, never through `sh -c`. The old inline-prompt form had to stay
//! single-line and free of both quote kinds; nothing here does.
//!
//! The charge is *ranked*, not a list of equal wishes. Decomposition outranks
//! shrinking, which outranks speed -- and all three are subordinate to the hard
//! constraint that the tree keep compiling while the orc works. A hobbit is
//! building this repo the whole time, so a red build is not a private
//! intermediate state.

//!   fn brief             -- the metaprompt, priority-ordered
//!   fn brief_oneline     -- the same text flattened for AppleScript embedding

HARD CONSTRAINT, above every goal below. This repository must compile, and the
program must still boot, at every moment you are working -- not merely when you
finish. Someone else is building and running this tree while you edit it, so a
red build is not a private intermediate state you can clean up later.

  - Before your first edit, run {build} and record the result. If the tree is
    already red, stop and report that. Do not refactor on top of a broken build.
  - Work in steps that each leave the build green. Additive first: create the new
    module, wire it into its parent, and compile, BEFORE you delete anything from
    the original file.
  - Re-run {build} after every step. If a step turns the build red and your very
    next edit does not make it green, revert that step and move on.
  - Never edit the build manifest, the entrypoint, or any file outside your
    target set in order to make your change compile. If your change needs that,
    it is out of scope: stop and report it.
  - Finish with {build} and {test} green, {boot} and paste the output of each.

PRIORITIES, highest first. Do the highest-ranked work that genuinely applies. Do
not drop to a lower rank because it is easier, and do not spread yourself thinly
across all three.

  1. DECOMPOSE -- this outranks the other two combined. If {target} carries more
     than one responsibility, split it into a nested module tree: one concern per
     file, each file opening with a header saying what it is for and listing the
     grep targets that reach its parts. A correct split is a complete result on
     its own. Ship it and stop rather than starting something else.
  2. SHRINK. Cut the line count of what remains without losing behaviour or
     documentation: delete dead code and unused imports, collapse duplicated
     branches and near-identical functions, replace hand-rolled loops with the
     standard idiom of this language. Report the before and after line count of
     every file you touched.
  3. SPEED, and only where the code itself makes the win evident: hoist repeated
     work out of a loop, drop a clone or an allocation of something large, replace
     a repeated linear scan with a lookup. State in one line why each change is
     faster. Do not guess at micro-optimizations you cannot argue for from the
     code in front of you, and never trade clarity for a speculative gain.

Behaviour must be identical. If a behaviour you are about to move has no test,
write one first. Confine every edit to {target} and the files you split out of it.",
