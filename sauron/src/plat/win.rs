//! The Windows half of `plat`: PowerShell and Windows Terminal standing in for
//! the shell and iTerm2.
//!
//! WHAT WINDOWS TERMINAL WILL AND WILL NOT DO
//! ------------------------------------------
//! The iTerm2 layer this replaces asks questions and gets answers: enumerate the
//! sessions of a tab, read each one's height, split the tallest, write text into
//! a specific pane. Windows Terminal has no scripting API at all. It has a
//! command line, `wt.exe`, which can only *do* things to the window it targets,
//! and only ever to whichever pane currently has focus.
//!
//! Three consequences, all of them visible to the user, none of them fixable
//! from here:
//!
//! * **No geometry.** The iTerm layer splits the tallest pane in a column,
//!   because repeatedly splitting the newest drives it under the minimum height
//!   and the split throws. `wt` cannot report a pane's size, so this splits the
//!   first pane in the column instead. On a column that is already crowded the
//!   split will fail where iTerm's would have succeeded.
//! * **Focus is positional, not addressed.** There is no "focus the pane running
//!   sauron". `sauron workspace` therefore records the pane index it assigned
//!   itself in `SAURON_WT_PANE` at launch and focuses back by index. Close a pane
//!   by hand and the indices shift underneath that.
//! * **No send-text.** Nothing can type into a pane that already exists, which is
//!   why `reply` is compiled out on this platform rather than approximated.
//!
//! STAGING AN ORC WITHOUT RUNNING IT
//! ---------------------------------
//! An orc is staged, never auto-run: the target has to be readable before
//! anything starts editing it. iTerm gets this with `write text ... newline no`,
//! which types the line and leaves it awaiting Enter. `wt split-pane <cmd>` has
//! no such mode -- it runs what you give it. So the pane opens on an interactive
//! shell with the command pushed onto the PSReadLine history and a banner saying
//! so: the command is one Up-arrow from running and zero risk of running itself.
//! That is the same contract, reached differently, and the difference is worth
//! knowing about because the keystroke is not the same keystroke.
//!
//! The argv these functions hand to `wt.exe` is built in `plat::wt`, which is
//! compiled on every platform so that its tests run on every platform. Only the
//! parts that genuinely touch Windows -- spawning, the environment, the probe --
//! are here.
//!
//! grep targets:
//!   fn pwsh_present     -- is PowerShell 7 installed
//!   fn wt_window        -- which WT window this process's workspace owns
//!   fn wt_pane          -- which pane index the Eye was given at launch
//!   fn run_wt           -- hand an argv to wt.exe and read its exit code
