//! Rendering.
//!
//! The board is three tables, not one list: YOUR MOVE, AWAITING TESTING and
//! WORKING, in that order, each with its own scroll and its own columns. An
//! empty table is omitted entirely, header and all.
//!
//! One line per session, and the line height is fixed. That is the whole point:
//! columns only line up while nothing expands a row, so the per-row detail --
//! the write-set, the last ask, the resume command -- lives in the detail pane
//! under the board, driven by the selected row. The previous board gave the
//! selected session up to twelve lines and every other session four, which read
//! well at five sessions and was a wall at fifteen.
//!
//! Column widths are solved, not hard-coded: the fixed columns are met first,
//! the name takes what is left with a floor of `NAME_MIN`, and a row that will
//! not fit gives up whole columns in the order `columns` names rather than
//! shaving every column to unreadable. A sauron pane in a four-agent workspace
//! is 52 columns wide, so this is a load-bearing case and not a courtesy.
//!
//! The header answers a question before it reports anything: *which repo is
//! this?* Sauron is run several at a time, one pane per project, so a board
//! that names itself quietly is a board you will act on believing it is a
//! different one. The name goes up in block letters when the terminal can spare
//! the rows (see `scene::Watching`), and in a filled badge when it cannot.
//!
//! grep targets:
//!   fn draw            -- top-level layout
//!   fn header          -- the status tally, and how the repo gets named
//!   fn look            -- glyph, colour, name style and table for one status
